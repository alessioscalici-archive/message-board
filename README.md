# ui-base â€” a complete build configuration for AngularJS projects

This project is a build configuration for AngularJS projects.
It's based on **angular-seed**, and adds a full set of tools to be ready to work
with AngularJS and LESS. It is based on **gulp**.

The project contains a sample AngularJS application and is preconfigured to install the Angular
framework and a bunch of development and testing tools.

Features:

- LESS, CSS, Javascript and HTML minification (prod mode)
- Cache busting
- Version bumping
- Automatic script / stylesheet injection in the index file
- Templates module (html2js)
- Unit test (Karma)
- E2E test (Protractor) with Page / Component abstraction structure
- Coverage report (Karma coverage)
- Complexity report (Plato)
- JS lint and code style checks
- Watch mode


It's designed to use the Angular's modular structure, allowing using separate modules for different features.


## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

Git: [http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/).

NodeJS: [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).


### Install Dependencies

Run

```
npm install
```

to install node and bower components at once

### Build the Application
The application can be built in development and production mode.

In **development** mode:

- A JS linter and code style check is performed
- Unit tests are run
- A coverage report is generated (in ```http://localhost:8000/report/coverage```)
- A complexity report is generated (in ```http://localhost:8000/report/complexity```)
- The project ```src``` folder structure is preserved in the ```build``` directory
- The LESS files are compiled into CSS
- The _meta and _templ modules are generated
- The JS and CSS files are injected in the index.html file
- The metadata in ```src/meta.json``` is aligned with ```bower.json``` and ```package.json```

In **production** mode:

- The application is built in development mode, then:
- The template files are minified and cached in the _templ Angular module
- The CSS files are concatenated and minified and stored in the ```css/styles.min.css``` file
- The JS files are concatenated and minified in the ```js/app.min.js``` file
- The ```index.html``` is injected with the JS and CSS (with a cache buster query parameter hash) and then minified
- The project version is bumped


If you have Gulp installed globally, run:

```bash
gulp dev               # builds the application in development mode
gulp prod              # builds the application in production mode
gulp prod -v 0.1.2     # builds in production mode and sets the version to 0.1.2
gulp prod -v patch     # builds in production mode and bumps the patch version (2.2.2 -> 2.2.3)
gulp prod -v minor     # builds in production mode and bumps the minor version (2.2.2-> 2.3.0)
gulp prod -v major     # builds in production mode and bumps the major version (2.2.2 -> 3.0.0)
```
Otherwise:

```bash
npm run dev            # builds the application in development mode
npm run prod           # builds the application in production mode
npm run prod-patch     # builds in production mode and bumps the patch version (2.2.2 -> 2.2.3)
npm run prod-minor     # builds in production mode and bumps the minor version (2.2.2-> 2.3.0)
npm run prod-major     # builds in production mode and bumps the major version (2.2.2 -> 3.0.0)
```

### Reports

- **Coverage report:** [http://localhost:8000/report/coverage](http://localhost:8000/report/coverage), generated every time Karma runs the unit tests (```gulp karma```, also launched on build)
- **Complexity report:** [http://localhost:8000/report/complexity](http://localhost:8000/report/complexity) generated by plato (```gulp plato```, also launched on build)
- **ngDocs documentation:** [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) generated by ngdocs (```gulp ngdoc```, also launched on build)


### Watch mode
In watch mode, the application is built in **development** mode, then gulp-watch will watch changes in the project files to automatically reflect those change in the build directory.
No checks are performed during the watch, so before releasing it's recommended to stop the watch and rebuild the application using the **dev** or **prod** Gulp tasks

If you have Gulp installed globally, run:

```bash
gulp watch
```
Otherwise:

```bash
npm run watch
```

### Run the Application

There is a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8000/build/index.html`.



## Directory Layout

```
src/                  --> all of the source files for the application
  vendor/                 --> bower third-party packages
    ...
  assets/                 --> assets folder for images, fonts etc.
    ...
  modules/                --> folder containing all Angular modules
  
    <module name>/       --> module folder
    
      module.js    		  --> the module declaration file, contains just the module dependency statement
      
      config/            --> optional folders containing the code, separated by type
      constants/
      controllers/
      directives/
      services/
      templates/
      
          
  index.html              --> main index file (the main html template file of the app)
  _templ.js               --> template file for the template constant-map
  meta.json               --> contains development metadata (info on version, environment, apps etc.)
  
karma.conf.js             --> config file for running unit tests with Karma


e2e-tests/                --> end-to-end tests
  conf/                   --> Protractor config files
    ...
  abstract/               --> PageObject and Component abstraction objects
    ...
  pages/                  --> application-specific PageObjects
    ...
  specs/                  --> test-case specification files
    ...
gulpfile.js               --> Gulp tasks definition


build/                    --> the compiled application files
```


### Adding a new module
To add a module called ```myModule``` to an application:

1. add a new folder to the ```src/modules``` folder, called ```myModule``` (the module name)
2. create a ```module.js``` file inside the ```myModule``` folder. This file has to contain **ONLY** the Angular module declaration.
3. add the new module to the main module dependencies (in the main module's ```module.js``` file)




### Running Unit Tests

The app comes preconfigured with unit tests. These are written in
[Jasmine][jasmine], which we run with the [Karma Test Runner][karma]. There is a Karma
configuration file to run them.

* the configuration is found at `karma.conf.js`
* the unit tests are found next to the code they are testing and are named as `....test.js`.

To run the unit tests, use the supplied gulp task:

```bash
gulp karma
```

or, if you don't have Gulp installed globally:

```bash
npm run test
```

This script will start the Karma test runner to execute the unit tests.

A coverage html report will be generated, it will be available at ```http://localhost:8000/report/coverage```.

A complexity html report will be generated, it will be available at ```http://localhost:8000/report/complexity```.


### End to end testing

**Prerequisites**: you should have webdriver and protractor installed globally.
Install them running 

```
npm install protractor -g
```
**Then**:

1. Run the HTTP server with ``` npm start ```
2. Run the webdriver server with ``` webdriver-manager start ```
3. Run protractor with ``` npm run e2e ```

In addition, since Protractor is built upon WebDriver we need to install this.  There
is a predefined script to do this:

```
npm run update-webdriver
```

This will download and install the latest version of the stand-alone WebDriver tool.

Once you have ensured that the development web server hosting our application is up and running
and WebDriver is updated, you can run the end-to-end tests using the supplied npm script:

```
npm run protractor
```

This script will execute the end-to-end tests against the application being hosted on the
development server.




### Building a new application
To generate a new application, add a new voice to the ```src/meta.json``` file, under the **apps** property. The structure of the voice should be:
<pre>
{
    "module" : "mainAppModule",      // the main app module name
    "index" : "path/to/index.html",  // the app index.html file
    "vendor" : {                     // lists of vendor files (external modules)
    	"head" : {							// to inject in the &lt;head&gt; tag...
    		"dev" : [],                       // in dev mode
    		"prod" : []                       // in prod mode (minified versions)
    	},
    	"body" : {							// to inject in the &lt;body&gt; tag...
    		"dev" : [],                       // in dev mode
    		"prod" : []                       // in prod mode (minified versions)
    	}
    }
}
</pre>
